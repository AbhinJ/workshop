msgid "`pgRouting <http://www.pgrouting.org>`_ adds routing functionality to `PostGIS <http://www.postgis.org>`_. This introductory workshop will show you how. Providing practical examples using  `OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ road network data. Covering from how to prepare the data, make routing queries, write a custom 'plpgsql' functions up to draw your route in a web-mapping application. In other words, integrating pgRouting with other FOSS4G tools."
