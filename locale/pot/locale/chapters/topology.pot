msgid ":doc:`osm2pgrouting <osm2pgrouting>` is a convenient tool, and its focus to work on OpenStreetMap data. There are several cases where :doc:`osm2pgrouting <osm2pgrouting>` can't be used. Some network data already comes with a network topology that can be used with pgRouting out-of-the-box. Often network data is stored in Shape file format (``.shp``) and we can use PostGIS' ``shp2pgsql`` converter to import the data into a PostgreSQL database."
